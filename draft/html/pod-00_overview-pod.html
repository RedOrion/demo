<p>Overview of the Disaster Recovery and Automated Failover Test system (DRAFT)</p>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'

>DESCRIPTION</a></h1>

<p>This document provides an introduction and an overview of <b>DRAFT</b> with links to further documentation.</p>

<p>Most of the documentation is in POD form however there are a few documents in Word and Visio format which can be found in the <b>document</b> directory.</p>

<p>The design splits DRAFT into two systems,
a <b>Controller</b> and an <b>Agent</b>.
Software for the two components are packaged together.</p>

<p>A component (a Controller and it&#39;s corresponding Agents) performs a specific action,
for example it may start or stop an application or process or take a storage device off-line.
Each component is given it&#39;s own namespace based on it&#39;s function.</p>

<p>Controllers and their corresponding Agents are highly compenentised and use a plugin system to allow the expansion of new components without having to make any modifications to existing code.</p>

<p>Controllers and Agents can either be on the same system or on different one&#39;s.
When the Controller and the Agent are on different systems they communicate via a Transport Layer.
The transport layer is transparent to the component using it.
Different transport layers can be used depending upon circumstances.</p>

<p>A <b>Workflow</b> layer and an <b>Application</b> layer sit above the Controllers.</p>

<p>The <b>Workflow</b> layer is responsible for co-ordinating the sequence of events to make a changeover of a production system to it&#39;s disaster recovery configuration or vice-versa.</p>

<p>The <b>Application</b> layer initialises the various components required by the Workflow.</p>

<p>The Workflow layer can be controlled by a <b>Web API</b> to initialize a failover test and to obtain the results.
Some of this functionality can also be carried out via a <b>Command Line Interface</b></p>

<p>Finally,
most of the parameters required by the system are obtained by an interface to the <b>A2RM</b> system.</p>

<p>Refer to the file documents/application_layout.vsd for a basic diagram of the system.</p>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Example_Controller_and_Agent"
>Example Controller and Agent</a></h1>

<p>The following is an example plugin for a Controller and an Agent.
This example shows a component that can start or stop an application on a Linux system.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Controller"
>Controller</a></h2>

<pre>    package Nomura::DRAFT::Controller::Plugin::App::Control;
    use Moose;

    extends &#39;Nomura::DRAFT::Controller::Plugin&#39;;

    1;</pre>

<p>This is the simplest definition of a Controller, but nevertheless it it a working one. There are no methods defined in the controller (although there could be) since in this example all code is executed on the Agent side.</p>

<p>All Controllers are in the namespace Nomura::DRAFT::Controller::Plugin and must be created as OO Code using the cpan module <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moose" class="podlinkpod"
>Moose</a>. Most of the heavy lifting and shifting is carried out in <!--PODLINK--><a href='lib-Nomura-DRAFT-Controller-Plugin-pm.html' class='podlinkpod'>Nomura::DRAFT::Controller::Plugin</a>.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Agent"
>Agent</a></h2>

<pre>    package Nomura::DRAFT::Agent::Linux::Plugin::App::Control;

    use Moose::Role;

    # Start an application
    sub start {
        my ($self) = @_;

        my $app     = $self-&#62;data-&#62;app_name;
        my $ret_val = system(&#34;/etc/init.d/$app start&#34;);
        $self-&#62;data-&#62;status($ret_val);
    }

    # Stop an application
    sub stop {
        my ($self) = @_;

        my $app     = $self-&#62;data-&#62;app_name;
        my $ret_val = system(&#34;/etc/init.d/$app stop&#34;);
        $self-&#62;data-&#62;status($ret_val);
    }
    1;</pre>

<p>Again this is a simple example, with little error checking and no <b>dry_run</b> facility, it simply relies on making a system call to start or stop the specified application. The return status is then put into the shared data structure (see below) to be returned to the controller.</p>

<p>In this case the base namespace is Nomura::DRAFT::Agent::Linux::Plugin since the Agent is specific to the Linux operating system. A Windows version of this agent would be in the namespace Nomura::DRAFT::Agent::Windows::Plugin</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Shared_Data"
>Shared Data</a></h2>

<p>Communication between the Controller and the Agent is via a shared data structure.</p>

<pre>    package Nomura::DRAFT::SharedData::App::Control;

    use Moose;

    extends &#39;Nomura::DRAFT::SharedData&#39;;

    # Name of application
    has &#39;app_name&#39;  =&#62; (
        is          =&#62; &#39;rw&#39;,
        isa         =&#62; &#39;Str&#39;,
        required    =&#62; 1,
    );
    1;</pre>

<p>This is a very simple example, the only data shared between the Controller and the Agent is the name of the application. Again this module has to be defined using the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moose" class="podlinkpod"
>Moose</a> OO framework and it must <b>extend &#39;<!--PODLINK--><a href='lib-Nomura-DRAFT-SharedData-pm.html' class='podlinkpod'>Nomura::DRAFT::SharedData</a>&#39;</b> and be in that namespace.</p>

<p>Nomura::DRAFT::SharedData, it&#39;s parent class, defines a few other attributes, such as the <b>status</b> field shown above in the code for an Agent, a <b>log</b> field, a <b>dry_run</b> field (which should be used to do everything except execute any changes to the system). These will be described in greater detail later.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Application_code"
>Application code</a></h2>

<p>The Application layer would normally carry out any initialisation of the Controller object and the calling of the start and stop methods, but for the purpose of this example there is no reason why we could not call them directly.</p>

<pre>    #!/usr/bin/perl

    use Moose;

    use Nomura::DRAFT::SharedData::App::Control;
    use Nomura::DRAFT::Transport::Socket::Controller;
    use Nomura::DRAFT::ServerFactory;

    # Create a socket based transport layer
    my $transport = Nomura::DRAFT::Transport::Socket::Controller-&#62;new({
        local_host      =&#62; &#39;lonlx20575&#39;,
        peer_port       =&#62; 55543,
        peer_address    =&#62; &#39;lonlx20575&#39;,
    });

    # Set the shared data
    my $shared_data = Nomura::DRAFT::SharedData::App::Control-&#62;new({
        app_name    =&#62; &#39;myapp&#39;,
    });

    my $controller = Nomura::DRAFT::ServerFactory-&#62;create(&#39;App::Control&#39;, {
        transport       =&#62; $transport,
        data            =&#62; $shared_data,
        verbs           =&#62; [qw(start stop)],
    });</pre>

<p>This example initialises a transport layer, the shared data for use by both the controller and the agents and the controller itself.</p>

<p>The <b>verbs</b> part of the initialization define what methods can be called across the transport layer. Any verbs defined during the creation of the Controller are vivified on the Controller object and automatically made available across the transport layer to the Agent.</p>

<p>For example, having created a Controller as above we can call the &#39;start&#39; verb.</p>

<pre>    if ($controller-&#62;start == 0) {
        print &#34;Application &#34;.$controller-&#62;data-&#62;app_name.&#34; started correctly\n&#34;;
    }
    else {
        print &#34;ERROR: the application failed to start. &#34;.$application-&#62;data-&#62;log;
    }
    $transport-&#62;quit;</pre>

<p>Assuming that the Controller and the Agent are on different machines, the sequence of events is as follows.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="start_is_called_in_the_controller."
><b>start</b> is called in the controller.</a></dt>

<dd>
<dt><a name="the_transport_layer_will_serialize_the_shared_data_and_transmit_it_to_the_Agent"
>the transport layer will serialize the shared data and transmit it to the Agent</a></dt>

<dd>
<dt><a name="the_transport_layer_on_the_Agent_will_deserialize_the_shared_data,_and_instantiate_an_Agent_object."
>the transport layer on the Agent will deserialize the shared data, and instantiate an Agent object.</a></dt>

<dd>
<dt><a 
>the <b>start</b> method of the Agent is called where the work is done as seen in the above example. During this process the shared data may be modified.</a></dt>

<dd>
<dt><a 
>on returning from the Agent <b>start</b> method, the shared data is re-serialized on the Agent and de-serialized on the Controller.</a></dt>

<dd>
<dt><a 
>the Controller code can now continue execution, checking the status of the shared data and printing any log information that may have been gathered.</a></dt>

<dd>
<dt><a 
>either more <b>verbs</b> can be called on this connection, or when finished the transport layer can be told to <b>quit</b> which will close the connection between the Controller and the Agent.</a></dt>
